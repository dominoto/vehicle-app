# vehicle-app

This was a test assignment for a Frontend job selection procedure. Mandatory technologies were React, MobX and mobx-react-form. I also used Vite environment, React Router DOM for routing, ag-grid for showing the lists, Firebase Realtime Database to store and fetch data, and gh-pages to deploy the frontend online.

### Test project info

Develop a minimalistic application of your choice by following the requirements defined below. Note that we proposed a Vehicle-related application, but you can choose anything you prefer.
Create a list/grid page where the list/grid should have paging, sorting, and filtering functionality.
Paging, sorting and filtering should be executed through REST API calls.
Also, add other CRUD functionalities (not just reading and editing).
Create edit pages for the list/grid on their routes.
Create and edit pages should have form validation.
You should use one of the available REST API services, like Firebase - https://firebase.google.com/, or create your own REST API service.
The REST API service should store the following elements:
VehicleMake (Id, Name, Abrv) e.g. BMW, Ford, Volkswagen,
VehicleModel (Id, MakeId, Name, Abrv) e.g. 128, 325, X5 (BWM)
In your database, these two entities should be connected through the MakeId field.
